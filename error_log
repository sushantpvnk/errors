sushant@sushant-VirtualBox:~$ minikube start
😄  minikube v1.33.1 on Ubuntu 24.04 (vbox/amd64)
👎  Unable to pick a default driver. Here is what was considered, in preference order:
    ▪ docker: Not healthy: "docker version --format {{.Server.Os}}-{{.Server.Version}}:{{.Server.Platform.Name}}" exit status 1: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/version": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
    ▪ docker: Suggestion: Add your user to the 'docker' group: 'sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker' <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/>
💡  Alternatively you could install one of these drivers:
    ▪ kvm2: Not installed: exec: "virsh": executable file not found in $PATH
    ▪ podman: Not installed: exec: "podman": executable file not found in $PATH
    ▪ qemu2: Not installed: exec: "qemu-system-x86_64": executable file not found in $PATH
    ▪ virtualbox: Not installed: unable to find VBoxManage in $PATH

❌  Exiting due to DRV_NOT_HEALTHY: Found driver(s) but none were healthy. See above for suggestions how to fix installed drivers.
